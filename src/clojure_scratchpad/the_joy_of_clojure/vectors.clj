;;;Subvectors
;;;Although items canâ€™t be removed efficiently from a vector (except the rightmost
;;;item), Clojure provide a fast way to take a slice of an existing vector such as a-to-j
;;;(previously defined as [\A \B \C \D \E \F \G \H \I \J]) based on start and end indices
;;;with the subvec function:

;;; Wonder If its faster to just make three slices and drop the middle as a new vect?
